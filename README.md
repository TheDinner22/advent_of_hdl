# free t-shirt

I'm competeing for a free t-shirt, which is super serious.

One of the rules is that I have to open source (feed AI) my code so here it is :)

## what is this

This is a (sort of WIP) set of hardcaml projects for aoc 2025

As I'm writing this, I have only done ***Day one Part 1***, but I'm planning on doing more.

## docs

### folder structure

- d1p1 - day one part 1
- in general: dnpn = day n part n


Inside each folder there is a dune project and a pdf I wrote. 
The pdf documents my thought process, bugs encountered, opionions, etc.

### how to run

1. cd into one of the folders
2. `dune runtest`
3. send me free t-shirt please :)
